                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>The problem of climate change in India is multi-faceted and complex, affecting various sectors such as agriculture, water resources, health, and infrastructure. The country has already experienced the adverse impacts of climate change, with rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events.

                        Heatwaves, for example, have become more severe and prolonged, leading to a higher incidence of heat-related illnesses and deaths. Floods and droughts have also become more frequent and severe, affecting agricultural productivity and food security. In addition, climate change is affecting India's biodiversity, with species loss and altered ecosystem services.</p>
